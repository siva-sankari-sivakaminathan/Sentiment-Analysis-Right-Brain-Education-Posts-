**Sentiment Analysis-Right Brain Education Posts**

**Objective**

This project is as part of one of my courseworks on my Masters degree course. The idea is to do sentiment analysis and identify POS tags of positive and negative posts on Facebook and Instagram. THe posts are related to right brain education for kids under 3 years old.

Right brain education is a learning approach that focuses on stimulating the right hemisphere of the brain. The theory goes that the right brain is responsible for creativity, intuition, spatial reasoning, and other non-logical skills, while the left brain handles logic, language, and analytical thinking.
